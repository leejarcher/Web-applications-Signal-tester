	      <p>The current application, Signal tester, 
		  is being written primarily on an Android phone using the 
	      web audio API to act as a signal generator
	      along with a peak reading level meter, basic oscilloscope and spectrum analyser.
	      The generator and analyser use seperate browser windows that are navigated 
	      between using the buttons at the top of the two screens.</p>
	      <p>The generator provides the standard waveforms plus a custom and WAV waveform 
	      option. There are two generators that can be mixed together or waveform 2, at the 
	      bottom, can amplitude or frequency modulate the top waveform. 
		  Generator two can additionally take its waveform source from the microphone.</p>
	      <p>The output level of each oscillator is variable between -10 and +10, with negative values
	      indicating a phase inversion of 180&deg;.</p>
	      <p>The two custom waveforms use fourier coefficients to generate the waveforms, additive synthesis, 
	      with both files holding the coefficients being updateable.
	      The WAV waveforms, again, can be modified by supplying your own WAV files.</p>
